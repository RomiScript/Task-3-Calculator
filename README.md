This is the third task on my "12 Labors of Hercules" Front-End challenge.

It´s a calculator, yayyy!
I've been resisting calculators; nobody wants to see one, but... I've never made a pretty calculator. The others I've made have been even better in terms of code, but this one is cute, and I made it in about 20 minutes. 
Now I can get this task out of the way, and just like Hercules did, I can gradually increase the level of difficulty.

Tech:
HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.
